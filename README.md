# amznotes-typst

amznotes-typst is a typst template that attempts to achieve the similar style of the pretty latex template [amznotes](https://github.com/alexmingzhang/amznotes). We would not claim that this template is perfect, but it should be a good starting point for those who want to use amznotes but prefer a shorter compile time.

## Usage

Clone this repository to your work directory and import the template file `tmplate.typ` into your document.

```typst
#import "amznotes-typst/template.typ"
```

You may need to install the fonts below, which are used in the template:

- STIX Two Text
- STIX Two Math

## Develop Plan

- [ ] Add shadow for amzbox
- [ ] Support code block

## License
